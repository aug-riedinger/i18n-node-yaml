i18n-node-yaml
==============

## Motivations

Yet another translation module for node? Not quite.

I created this repo for two main reasons:

### 1. Lack of YAML support in the [main translation module](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node)

Despite [having been PRed](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node/pull/79) it was never merged, which induces a lack of maintenance.

Most people agree that YAML is a better format for writing translations as content is naturally aligned, and require few special character tweaks.

It means a non-techie could definitely maintain his own version of a translation file, at very little risks.

### 2. Inverted translation position

Get content organised files:

```
# translations.yml

hello:
  world:
    en: Hello World
    fr: Bonjour le monde
foo:
  bar: Foo bar
```

Instead of what all translation module I have ever used do: language organised files:

```
# en.yml

hello:
  world: Hello World
foo:
  bar: Foo bar
```

and

```
# fr.yml

hello:
  world: Bonjour le monde
foo:
  bar: Foo bar
```

I can't find how this structure can be easily maintainable. [I already asked the question on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25664708/rails-i18n-separate-language-key-at-the-end-of-the-tree), without much success. :s

Having translated myself several websites, I have always found super efficient to manage **one** file.

Here are the immediate advantages I get:
- No need to duplicate if word is international/not translatable (eg. `foo.bar`)
- 1 single file to edit when tree structure moves (and it regularly does)
- Visually obvious which translations are missing
- Instant evaluation of the necessity to translate (eg. English `Contact` will do at first then will be translated by `Kontact` in German eventually)
- Super easy to translate : the original source is only 1 line above! No need fancy software to do that.
- Files are organized by content, not translations

I'd be curious to hear some cons on this, but I hardly can see any!

## Install

Nothing fancy:

```
npm install i18n-node-yaml --save
```

## Usage

### Quick start

Inspired by [its grand-bother](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node), the syntax goes:

```
// app.js
const i18n = require('i18n-node-yaml')({
  debug: app.get('environment') !== 'production',
  translationFolder: __dirname + '/translations',
  locales: ['en_US', 'fr_FR'],
  defaultLocale: 'en_US',
  queryParameters: ['lang'],
});

i18n.ready.catch(err => {
  console.error('Failed loading translations', err);
});

app.use(i18n.middleware);
```

Translations become available in the `req`/`res` objects with:

```
// Any controller

req.t('translations.hello.world');
// OR
res.locals.t('translations.foo.bar');
```

The `res.locals.t` syntax makes it accessible in an `ejs`/`pug` view immediately:

```
// index.pug
html(lang=getLanguage())
  head
    meta(property='og:locale', content=getLocale())
    for language in getLocales().filter(lang => lang !== getLocale())
      meta(property='og:locale:alternate', content=language)
  body
    p= t('translations.hello.world')
```

### Set the locale/language

There are 4 successive ways to set/detect locale in the middleware.

1. **Query parameter**: Querying `/whatever?lang=en`, modifies the locale for the current query, and updates the cookie for the next ones.
2. **Cookie**: If absent, the middleware looks for the cookie value
3. **Header**: If absent, it goes for the best match from the `accept-language` header.
4. **Default locale**: If none of the above matched, then `defaultLocale` is used.

The `?lang=` query parameter can be changed within the options by updating the `queryParameters` (note that this is an array, multiple values can be accepted).

### API:

- `getLocale()`: returns the current locale. Eg. `'en_US'`
- `getLanguage()`: returns the current langage. Eg. `'en'`
- `getLocales()`: returns an array of available locales: Eg. `['en_US', 'fr_FR']`
- `getLanguages()`: returns an array of available languages: Eg. `['en', 'fr']`
- `t(root, path, data, locale)`:

  - **`root` (type: `Object`, optional)** : is the object to get translations from. It is optional as by default its value is the whole translations tree. But it can be useful in the case of an array of values:

    ```
    # elements.yml

    list:
      - key: foo
        value:
          en: I am crazy
          fr: Je suis fou
      - key: bar
        value:
          en: I like bars
          fr: J'aime les bars
      - key: baz
        value:
          en: I'm downstairs
          fr: Je suis en baz
    ```

    ```
    //- index.pug
    each element in t('elements.list')
      p(data-key=t(element, 'key'))= t(element, 'value')
    ```

  - **`path` (type: `string`, required)** : is the dot-separated succession of keys to access the value from the root. If root is not set, `path` becomes the first argument

    You can write, back to the example above: `t('elements.list.0.value')` but you are more likely to loop over the values of the array

  - **`data` (type: `object`, optional)** : allows to make string interpolation in translations.

    Eg.

    ```
    # emails.yml

    welcome:
      en: |
        Welcome ${name},
        Click on this [link](${link}) to continue.
        Best
      fr: |
        Bienvenue ${name},
        Cliquez sur ce [lien](${link}) pour poursuivre.
        Bien Ã  vous
    ```

    Then `t('emails.welcome', {name: 'Robert', link: 'http://example.com'})` will work as expected.

  - **`locale` (type: `string`, optional)** : most of the time you will use the selected locale in the middleware, but it is possible to override it: `t('translations.hello.world', {}, 'fr')`.

## TODOs

Feel free to contribute.

The most urgent topic will probably be:

- deal with pluralization (I haven't had the need until now)
